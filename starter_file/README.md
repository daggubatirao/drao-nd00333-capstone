# Capstone Project: Heart Failure Prediction

## Overview
This project is part of Udacity Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree capstone requirement. In this Project, we build Azure Machine Learning model using AutoML and HyperDrive, then deploy the best performing model.  The model is deployed to Azure Container Service using Azure ML Python SDK.

In Azure Machine Learning Studio, an AutoML run is configured for the given dataset. The AutoML Run identifies the best model using a defined metric such as accuracy or AUC ..etc. The best model is then deployed to Azure Container Instances(ACI) or Azure Kubernetes Instances(AKI). The deployment creates an endpoint, and the endpoint can be managed using Python SDK. The model can invoked using the endpoint. Also, using the model reference, we can predict the heart failure using a test dataset.

## Project Set Up and Installation
The notebooks contain all the code required to load the dataset, configure the compute instance, the AutoML model and deply the best model.

## Dataset

### Overview
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure. Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

This Heart Failure PRediction dataset is downloaded from Kaggle. Death due to Heart Failure is predicted using information usch as anaemia, diabetes, high blood pressure, platelets, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, creatinine_phosporous and ejection_fraction(%bllod leaving the heart at each contraction).

### Task


### Access
I have downloaded the CSV file from Kaggle and uploaded into my repository. Everytime notebook ran, it checks if the data available in the workspace and uploads to datastore if the data doesn't exist in the workspace.

## Automated ML
Azure Maching Learning support automatic training and comparison of maching learning models using AutoML. To Run AutoML, an AutoMLConfig object needs to be created with paramteres such as dataset, training cluster, machine learning task, target column and metric to evaluate the algorithm. The following code snippet shows the parameters of the automl configutation.

The AutoMLconfig object is then submitted to an experiment, which runs AutoML on the specified data. The following picture shows the run settings of the AutoML run.

AutoML preprocessed the data, trains different models and ranks the models based on user selected metric. The following picture shows top 5 algorithms that autoML ran and ranked the runs based on the metric.

In this experiment, AutoML identified VotingEnsemble. The following picture shows the run settings of voting ensemble algorithm.

A voting ensemble is an ensemble machine learning model that combines the predictions from multiple other models. The following picture shows metrics generated by voting ensemble.

The AutoML fitted model can be obtained using the get_output() method of the AutoML run object. The fitted model describes the steps used in the model, the data transformations applied and the hyperparameters used in the model. In this experiment, AutoML used votingclassifier with hyperparameters min_weight_fraction_leaf=0.0,n_estimators=10,n_jobs=1,oob_score=False,random_state=None,verbose=0,warm_start=False . The following screenshot shows fitted model properties.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
AzureML supports hyperparameter tunig using hyperdrive package. Using hyperdrive, the parameter search space space can be defined using randon, grid or bayesian sampling. In the experiement, LogisticRegression classification was used. The training script loads the data, cleans that data, and runs LogisticRegression using the parameters supplied to the script and logs the metrics. The hyperdrive samples the paramters and calls the training script using a set of parameters at a time. Hyperdrive compares the metrics, and ranks the experiment runs based the specific metric. In this experiment, Accuracy was used to rank the runs.

In this experiment, RandomSampling was used to sample max_iter and C paramters. max_iter is the maximum number of iterations for the learning algorith to converge. In thix experiment, I have used discrete list values [500, 1000, 5000] for max_iter. C is the inverse of regularization strength. In this experiment, i have used discrete list values [100, 10, 5, 1.0, 2] for C. The Random Sampling selects combination max_iter and C. Random Sampling supports early termination of low-performance runs. The high level steps in hyperdrive pipeline are shown in the following diagram

The hyperdrive support early termination using a policy, which improves the performance. In this experiement, BanditPolicy was used to terminate runs where the primary metric is not within the specified slack factor/slack amount compared to best performing run.

The following picture shows the results of hyperdrive experiment, shows the runs with hyperparameters and results. The best performing model uses a value of 5 for C and 500 for max_iter

The best run model provides an accuracy of 0.9123. the following picture shows the metrics of the best performing model

## Model Deployment
Automate ML model gives better result so we deployed the best run of AutoML. Using Python SDK, the model can be deplyed to Azure Container Service.
